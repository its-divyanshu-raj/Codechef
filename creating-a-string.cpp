/* Strings are used for storing text.
A string variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes.
Before declaring a variable as string the string datatype must be used

for eg - string name = "Chef";
Write a program which does the following

Create a string named 
fruit and assign the value "Apple" to it.
Output fruit to the console. */ 





#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    string fruit = "Apple";
    cout<< fruit ;
    return 0;
